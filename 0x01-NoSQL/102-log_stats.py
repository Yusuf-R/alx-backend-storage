    This script provides some statistics about Nginx logs stored in MongoDB.
    It connects to a MongoDB instance running on localhost:27017, and retrieves
    all documents from the "nginx" collection in the "logs" database.

    It then counts the number of documents with each
    HTTP method ("GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"),
    and the number of documents with method="GET" and path="/status".

    The script prints the following information:
         - The total number of logs in the collection.
         - The number of logs for each HTTP method.
         - The number of logs with method="GET" and path="/status".
         - The top 10 present IPs in the collection nginx of the database logs
